class_name CrowdDirector
extends Node3D
## Keeps a living pedestrian crowd around the player: spawns varied peds at the
## edge of view, culls them once they fall far behind, and respawns to maintain
## a target headcount — so a district feels inhabited without ever paying for
## people the player can't see (roadmap M4: "spawn/despawn invisible to player").
##
## All placement uses CrowdDistribution (pure, tested); the peds themselves use
## the imported coastal-resident character variants. Ground height is taken
## from the player's Y — flat-world assumption for now; a navmesh/raycast
## sample is a later refinement.

## Optional scene override. The production scene is loaded after startup so its
## large character textures do not compete with the world transition.

## Auto-build a walkability map from the physics world the first time the crowd
## ticks: a coarse grid is raycast straight down and any cell whose ground is
## missing or sits above max_walkable_rise (a building, a wall, water with no
## floor) is marked blocked. Gives peds a real navmesh of the streets with zero
## coupling to how the world was built. Leave off for a flat sandbox.

## first (and so marks the footprint blocked) instead of starting inside a tall
## tower. Must clear the tallest building in range.

## Optional walkability map. Assigned by bake_nav, or set in code (stamp
## building/water footprints with NavGrid.block_world_rect). When present, spawns
## are rejected on blocked cells so pedestrians appear on streets and sidewalks,
## never inside a wall. Null = spawn anywhere (flat-sandbox behaviour).
