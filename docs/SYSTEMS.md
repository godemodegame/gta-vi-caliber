# Gameplay Systems Reference

A catalogue of the pure, unit-tested simulation systems that make up the GTA-style
gameplay layer, with their purpose, key API, and **how to wire each into a live
scene**. Every system here is a `class_name` you can `ClassName.new()` (stateful)
or call statically (pure helpers); all are headless unit-tested under
`game/tests/unit/test_*.gd`.

Most systems follow one of two repo patterns:

- **Pure model + thin node**: the math lives in a `RefCounted` model; a `Node`
  reads it and drives the engine (see `WantedTracker` wrapping `WantedSystem`).
- **Self-wiring coordinator**: a small `Node` that finds collaborators by group
  in `_ready`/`_process` and needs no per-scene plumbing (see `MissionReward`,
  `ProgressionTracker`, `StatsCoordinator`, `WantedEvasionController`,
  `PaySprayShop`). This is the lowest-friction way to wire a model into a scene.

Groups the live scene already publishes: `player`, `player_health`,
`player_stats`, `wanted`, `mission`, `police`, `stats`, `progression`, `world`,
`spawn_points`.

## Wanted / law enforcement

| System | Purpose | Key API | Wiring |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WantedSystem` | heat -> stars core | `add_crime`, `stars`, `is_wanted`, `tick` | wrapped by `WantedTracker` (group `wanted`) |
| `CrimeWitness` | a crime only raises heat if seen | `can_witness`, `count_witnesses`, `heat_for_crime`, report timer | gate `WantedTracker._on_crime` on `count_witnesses(crime_pos, peds)` before adding heat |
| `WantedEvasion` | "go cold" search timer | `update(seen, dt)`, `is_cold`, `search_progress` | wired live via `WantedEvasionController` (raycasts cop LOS) |
| `PaySpray` | respray/hideout instant clear | `cost_for`, `is_seen_entering`, instance respray timer | wired live via `PaySprayShop` Area3D (group `pay_spray`) |
| `Disguise` | change your look to lose the heat | `set_appearance`, `log_sighting`, `recognition`, `evasion_speedup`, `changed_slots` | `log_sighting` when the player is spotted; scale the `WantedEvasion` search delta by `evasion_speedup()` so a disguised player goes cold faster |
| `Wardrobe` | buy/own/wear clothing that feeds `Disguise` | `buy`, `wear`, `worn_looks`, `worn_look`, `items_in_slot` | a wardrobe UI buys against the wallet; push `worn_looks()` into `Disguise.set_appearance` per slot so a change of clothes changes recognition |
| `PoliceEscalation` | response tier per star | `response_units`, `has_swat/helicopter/military`, `aggression`, `weapon_tier` | feed `PoliceSpawner`: pick the scene + count per `response_units(stars)` |
| `PursuitTactics` | chase tactics | `intercept_point`, `should_ram`, `pit_side`, `choose_tactic` | drive `Police`/traffic-cop movement when chasing |
| `GangTerritory` | turf control | `add_influence`, `take_over`, `controlled_fraction` | a per-district influence tracker + a turf-war trigger |
| `FactionStanding` | per-faction reputation (-100 hostile..+100 allied) | `adjust`, `tier_of`, `will_attack`, `will_assist`, `to_dict` | adjust on player actions (rivalry bleeds onto enemies); NPC AI reads `will_attack`/`will_assist`; faction ids align with `GangTerritory` |

## Combat

| `ExplosionModel` | radial damage + knockback + chain | `damage_at`, `knockback`, `should_chain`, `apply_to_many` | on grenade/vehicle blast, query nearby hittables |
| `MeleeCombat` | combos / block / counter / stamina | `strike`, `block_reduction`, `counter_damage` | drive `MeleeController` strikes + a stamina HUD |
| `CombatCover` | cover-point eval | `provides_cover`, `best_cover`, `peek_position`, `is_exposed` | give `CombatAi`/`Police` cover-seeking behaviour |
| `StealthDetection` | awareness meter | `update(can_see, vis, dt)`, `is_alerted`, `detection_speed` | per-NPC perception atop `CrimeWitness` FOV |
| `FirePropagation` | spreading fire + fuel burnout | `ignite_intensity`, `update_fires`, `damage_per_second` | molotov/vehicle fire that spreads across flammables |
| `WeaponLoadout` | attachments (optic/muzzle/mag/grip) tune a weapon | `equip`, `mult_for`, `apply_mult`, `mag_size`, `is_suppressed` | a weapon-mod UI; apply `apply_mult(base, "spread"/"range"/"recoil")` around the `WeaponBallistics` calls, `mag_size` to ammo, `is_suppressed` to witness noise |

## Vehicles

| `VehicleHealth` | damage -> fire -> wreck | `apply_damage`, `tick`, `state`, `just_exploded` | on car damage; trigger `ExplosionModel` on wreck |
| `VehicleModShop` | tiered upgrades -> stat multipliers | `upgrade`, `top_speed_multiplier`, `grip_multiplier` | a mod-garage trigger; multipliers feed `VehicleHandling` |
| `Carjacking` | yank a driver out | `can_reach`, `door_side`, struggle timer, `heat_for_jack` | player enter-vehicle path + `WantedTracker.report_crime` |
| `GarageStorage` | store/retrieve/impound vehicles | `store`, `retrieve`, `impound`, `recover_from_impound` | a garage trigger + saved vehicle list |
| `ChopShop` | fence a vehicle: class × condition × demand × heat | `value`, `deliver`, `set_requests`, `rotate_requests`, `total_earned` | a chop-shop trigger reads the car's class + `VehicleHealth.health_fraction()`, calls `deliver` and pays the wallet; rotate most-wanted orders for bonus pay |
| `Parachute` | freefall/deploy/land | `deploy`, `update_fall_speed`, `landing_impact` | player skydive state above a height threshold |

## Already wired & CI-guarded in `miami.tscn`

The playable map runs the full loop, each gated by a runtime probe in
`tools/check.sh`: player health/stats/wanted/mission/bark + crowd/traffic/police
directors (`miami_wiring_probe`), crime -> wanted -> police dispatch
(`miami_loop_probe`), the 5-mission campaign paying money/respect/stats
(`miami_mission_probe`), pay-n-spray wanted-clear (`miami_payspray_probe`), and
the busted/arrest fail-loop (`miami_arrest_probe`). `WantedEvasionController`,
`MissionReward`, `ProgressionTracker`, `StatsCoordinator`, `MissionCampaign`,
`PaySprayShop`, and `SideJobBoard` are the self-wiring coordinators already in the
scene — copy their shape to wire the rest.

`MarketEventCoordinator` is a ready-to-drop self-wiring node (cf. PaySprayShop):
it owns a `StockMarket`, subscribes to the `wanted` group's `stars_changed` to
rally defense stocks on a crime spree, and applies `HitContract` effects via
`apply_hit_effect`. Its node-level wiring is CI-gated headless by
`tests/market_event_probe.gd` (a mock tree, no scene file). Adding it to
`miami.tscn` is the remaining step to make the stock-market loop live in play.

`CrimeReactionDirector` is its sibling on the same `wanted` hook: it owns a
`NewsBulletin` + `DistrictEconomy` and, on a wanted spike, files a severity-scaled
headline and heats the active district (which cools over time via `_process`). The
two directors split the signal cleanly — market vs news+real-estate — so both can
sit in the scene. CI-gated headless by `tests/crime_reaction_probe.gd`.

`CharacterSwitcher` owns a `CharacterRoster` and syncs each lead's wallet through
the live `player_stats` node on `request_switch()` (write the current wallet back,
load the incoming lead's), so per-character money persists across switches. CI-gated
headless by `tests/character_switch_probe.gd`.

`AmbientEventDirector` drives `AmbientEvents` on a timer: each tick it builds
`{stars (from the wanted group), district}`, rolls `trigger_next`, and emits
`encounter_triggered(id, kind)` for the scene to spawn. CI-gated headless by
`tests/ambient_event_probe.gd`.
